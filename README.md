# Golang Playground | Nick Brown
This repo is for my Go lang exercises and practice - I tend to run Go on vm instances and other computers that can vanish so I decided it would be handy to have a history of my learning of Go documented in a repo. 

What I'm most comfortable with (You give me any task that these are capable of and I'll be comfortable in building it):
- JS / TS / X libraries (with the Node JS runtime)
- Python
What I'm intermediate at (I can build systems with them but I have a lot of gaps in knowledge):
- C
- C++
- Java
- Ruby
What I'd like to add to my arsenal:
- Go lang
- Rust

I am a JS/TS dev seconded Python by nature, and the power of these languages (and communities) has often led me to jump in and build my projects and application systems using what I'm comfortable with. As I move into systems engineering roles and cloud platform management I want to document my learning of Go and other languages in code repositories so that I have them along with the magic of the internet to have the freedom to move in whichever direction my career send me.

I've made this public for anyone to use if you ever stumble across this hopefully something I do or write helps you.
